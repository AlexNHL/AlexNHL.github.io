### [Exploring Happiness Correlations with Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://github.com/AlexNHL/ml_dl_happiness)

* Explored correlations between happiness scores and various socioeconomic factors using statistical analysis
* Applied **machine learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} methods, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting
* Applied **deep learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} methods, including Multilayer Perception (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Predicted the happiness score and identified the most significant factors that contribute to happiness scores
* Conducted **error analysis**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to compare the performance of different models
* Applied psychological theories and research to provide a more comprehensive understanding


### [Data Visualization on Data Science Job Salaries in Tableau](https://github.com/AlexNHL/dv_ds_salary)

* Performed **data cleaning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} on ambiguous attributes, missing values, and irrelevant data
* Created **visualizations**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} and **calculation fields**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} that showed the distribution, trends, and percentage changes of salaries by different attributes
* Used **parameters**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to create interactive visualizations that allowed users to filter the data by different attributes
* Created a **dashboard**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} that combined multiple visualizations into a single view and allowed users to interactively explore the data with different filters
* Applied **actions**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to create interactivity between different visualizations in the dashboard, such as highlighting the data points in other visualizations when users selected a specific data in the map or chart


### [Web Application of Event Check System](https://github.com/AlexNHL/web_event)

* Developed an event check system for LCSD Cultural Programmes, enabling users to access event information across different locations
* Implemented the system using **React**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} for the front-end and **Node.js**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} with **Express**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} for the back-end
* Implemented user **authentication**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} and **authorization**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to allow for different roles such as admins and general users
* Utilized **MongoDB**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} as the database, containing user and event information
* Enabled users to search locations by keyword or categories, comment on events, and label locations as favorites


### [A JAVA-based Online Book Ordering System and Database Management](https://github.com/AlexNHL/db_book)

* Implemented an Online Book Ordering System using **JAVA**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} and **Oracle**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} Database
* Enabled users to log in to the main menu with different roles such as admins, general users, employees, or managers
* Allowed admins to modify the database by initializing, dropping, resetting all the tables and records, and generating the overview of all tables
* Enabled general users to search the database for books by different attributes, and with the capability to check their history of book orders, as well as the shipping status and information of their orders
* Allowed employees or managers to update the shipping status of the orders, view the orders grouped by different shipping status, and view the N most popular books

### [Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning Models and SMOTE](https://github.com/AlexNHL/ml_diabetes)

* Determined the best indicators for predicting whether a patient has diabetes and generated insights into each of these risk factors
* Adopted the **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to address the accuracy paradox caused by imbalanced dataset
* Applied **machine learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} models to classify diabetes, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Conducted **error analysis**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to compare the performance of different models


### [Applications of Hidden Markov Models in Earthquake Prediction](https://github.com/AlexNHL/hmm_earthquake)

* Identified seismicity patterns to evaluate earthquake risk in earthquake-prone areas
* Determined the best **Hidden Markov Models**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} for predicting earthquakes by global decoding **(Viterbi Algorithm)**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}
* Compared models with different hidden states by model selection and **residual diagnostics**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}
* Interpreted the meaning behind different hidden states and explored possible applications of the model
* Predicted the years with high-frequency earthquakes


### [Classifying Water Potability with Classification Models](https://github.com/AlexNHL/ml_potability)

* Classified water potability by its features, substance, chemical element, to determine whether it is safe for human consumption
* Preprocessed the data using procedures like **data cleaning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}, correlation, and feature scaling
* Compared the ROC curve and accuracy score of **machine learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} models: K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian process classification
* Identified the most suitable method by **error analysis**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}
