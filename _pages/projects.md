## Exploring Happiness Correlations with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

* Explored correlations between happiness scores and various socioeconomic factors using statistical analysis
* Applied machine learning methods, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting
* Applied deep learning methods, including Multilayer Perception (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Predicted the happiness score and identified the most significant factors that contribute to happiness scores
* Conducted error analysis to compare the performance of different models
* Applied psychological theories and research to provide a more comprehensive understanding

## Data Visualization on Insights of Data Science Job Salaries

* Performed data cleaning on ambiguous attributes, missing values, and irrelevant data
* Created visualizations and calculation fields that showed the distribution, trends, and percentage changes of salaries by different attributes
* Used parameters to create interactive visualizations that allowed users to filter the data by different attributes
* Created a dashboard that combined multiple visualizations into a single view and allowed users to interactively explore the data with different filters
* Applied actions to create interactivity between different visualizations in the dashboard, such as highlighting the data points in other visualizations when users selected a specific data in the map or chart


## Web Application of Event Check System

* Developed an event check system for LCSD Cultural Programmes, enabling users to access event information across different locations
* Implemented the system using React for the front-end and Node.js with Express for the back-end
* Utilized MongoDB as the database, containing user and event information
* Enabled users to search locations by keyword or categories, comment on events, and label locations as favorites


## Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning Models and SMOTE

* Determined the best indicators for predicting whether a patient has diabetes and generated insights into each of these risk factors
* Addressed the accuracy paradox caused by an imbalanced dataset by adopting the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
* Applied machine learning models to classify diabetes, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Conducted error analysis to compare the performance of different models


## Applications of Hidden Markov Models in Earthquake Prediction

* Identified seismicity patterns to evaluate earthquake risk in earthquake-prone areas
* Determined the best Hidden Markov Models for predicting earthquakes by global decoding (Viterbi Algorithm)
* Compared models with different hidden states by model selection and residual diagnostics
* Interpreted the meaning behind different hidden states and explored possible applications of the model
* Predicted the years with high-frequency earthquakes


## Classifying Water Potability with Classification Models

* Classified water potability by its features, substance, chemical element, to determine whether it is safe for human consumption
* Preprocessed the data using procedures like data cleaning, correlation, and feature scaling
* Compared the ROC curve and accuracy score of machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian process classification
* Identified the most suitable method by error analysis
