# Individual Project

## [Data Visualization on Data Science Job Salaries in Tableau](https://github.com/AlexNHL/dv_ds_salary)

* Performed **data cleaning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} on ambiguous attributes, missing values, and irrelevant data
* Created **visualizations**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} and **calculation fields**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} that showed the distribution, trends, and percentage changes of salaries by different attributes
* Used **parameters**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to create interactive visualizations that allowed users to filter the data by different attributes
* Created a **dashboard**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} that combined multiple visualizations into a single view and allowed users to interactively explore the data with different filters
* Applied **actions**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to create interactivity between different visualizations in the dashboard, such as highlighting the data points in other visualizations when users selected a specific data in the map or chart

# Group Project 

## Exploring Happiness Correlations with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

* Explored correlations between happiness scores and various socioeconomic factors using statistical analysis
* Applied **machine learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} methods, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting
* Applied **deep learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} methods, including Multilayer Perception (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Predicted the happiness score and identified the most significant factors that contribute to happiness scores
* Conducted **error analysis**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to compare the performance of different models
* Applied psychological theories and research to provide a more comprehensive understanding

## [Web Application of Event Check System](https://github.com/AlexNHL/web_event)

* Developed an event check system for LCSD Cultural Programmes, enabling users to access event information across different locations
* Implemented the system using **React**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} for the front-end and **Node.js**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} with **Express**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} for the back-end
* Utilized **MongoDB**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} as the database, containing user and event information
* Enabled users to search locations by keyword or categories, comment on events, and label locations as favorites


## Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning Models and SMOTE

* Determined the best indicators for predicting whether a patient has diabetes and generated insights into each of these risk factors
* Addressed the accuracy paradox caused by an imbalanced dataset by adopting the **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}
* Applied **machine learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} models to classify diabetes, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Conducted **error analysis**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} to compare the performance of different models


## Applications of Hidden Markov Models in Earthquake Prediction

* Identified seismicity patterns to evaluate earthquake risk in earthquake-prone areas
* Determined the best **Hidden Markov Models**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} for predicting earthquakes by global decoding **(Viterbi Algorithm)**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}
* Compared models with different hidden states by model selection and **residual diagnostics**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}
* Interpreted the meaning behind different hidden states and explored possible applications of the model
* Predicted the years with high-frequency earthquakes


## [Classifying Water Potability with Classification Models](https://github.com/AlexNHL/ml_potability)

* Classified water potability by its features, substance, chemical element, to determine whether it is safe for human consumption
* Preprocessed the data using procedures like **data cleaning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}, correlation, and feature scaling
* Compared the ROC curve and accuracy score of **machine learning**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"} models: K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian process classification
* Identified the most suitable method by **error analysis**{: style="color: DarkSlateBlue"}
