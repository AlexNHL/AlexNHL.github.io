## Exploring Happiness Correlations with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

* Analyzed the correlation between the happiness score and multiple socioeconomical factors
* Predicted the happiness score based on these factors and identified significant factors
* Applied machine learning methods, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, to regress the happiness score index
* Applied deep learning methods, including Multilayer Perception (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Conducted error analysis to compare the performance of different models
* Applied psychological theories and research to support the results


## Web Application of Event Check System

* Developed an event check system for LCSD Cultural Programmes, enabling users to access event information across different locations
* Implemented the system using React for the front-end and Node.js with Express for the back-end
* Utilized MongoDB as the database, containing all user and event information
* Incorporated responsive web design for optimal user experience
* Provided users with access to information about events and locations through a separate table
* Enabled users to search locations by keyword or categories, comment on events, and label locations as favorites


## Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning Models and SMOTE

* Determined the best indicators for predicting whether a patient has diabetes and generated insights into each of these risk factors
* Addressed the accuracy paradox caused by an imbalanced dataset by adopting the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
* Applied machine learning models to classify diabetes, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
* Conducted error analysis to compare the performance of different models


## Applications of Hidden Markov Models in Earthquake Prediction

* Identified seismicity patterns to evaluate earthquake risk in earthquake-prone areas
* Determined the best Hidden Markov Models for predicting earthquakes by global decoding (Viterbi Algorithm)
* Compared models with different hidden states by model selection and residual diagnostics
* Interpreted the meaning behind different hidden states and explored possible applications of the model
* Predicted the years with high-frequency earthquakes


## Classifying Water Potability with Classification Models

* Used classifiers to classify the substance, chemical element, and feature of water to determine if it is safe for human consumption
* Built classification models in machine learning to classify water potability
* Preprocessed the data using procedures like data cleaning, correlation, and feature scaling
* Compared the ROC curve and accuracy score of four machine learning models: K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm classifier, random forest classifier, SVM classifier, and SGD classifier
* Identified the most suitable method by error analysis for classifying water potability
