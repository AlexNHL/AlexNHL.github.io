# Welcome!

I am currently a student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), majoring in *Statistics*{: style="color: red"}. I have a passion for statistical machine learning, deep learning, and statistical inference using both parametric and non-parametric methods.

I am deeply intrigued by the power of data-driven approaches to address complex challenges and uncover insights in the real world. As a statistics student, I have cultivated a solid understanding of statistical theory and methodology, as well as the practical skills in programming.

On this website, you'll find information about my academic and background, as well as examples of my work in statistical machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, data visualization, web development and statistical inference.
